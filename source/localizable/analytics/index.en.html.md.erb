Analytics is a project to measure how users interact with partners websites.

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
> If you have **already** successfully integrated Analytics but you ran into
> `Uncaught TypeError: sa is not a function` error,
> check [New Analytics Tracking Script Migration Guide](/analytics/new_script_migration_guide).

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Quick Start

To successfully report your sales insights you have to:

1. Integrate the Analytics Tracking Script into your website
2. Declare <%= link_to 'Ecommerce', 'ecommerce' %> actions to report your data
3. Place test orders to validate your integration
4. Become GDPR Compliant

You can also check if there is a <%= link_to 'library', '/analytics/libraries' %> already available for you ecommerce platform.

> ##### Note
> To validate that the script is sending data properly, we offer a developer page with info about the reported data.
>
> Request the link from the shop owner.
>
> **Important**: *That link will be accessible only during the testing phase of integration.*

### Step 1: Integrate the Analytics Tracking Script

Add the following snippet just before closing either the `<head>` or `<body>` section in all of your website template
pages.

Use the <%= link_to 'session:connect', 'settings/#connect' %> command to initialize the tracker object for
your Account.

#### Tracking Code JS Snippet

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/js_snippet' %>

> ##### Note
> You **have to** replace the `'SA-XXXX-YYYY'` property with the actual
> *Shop Account ID* you received from us.
>
> For your shop to report all required data to Analytics you
> **must** <%= link_to 'declare ecommerce data', '/analytics/', anchor: 'step-2-declare-ecommerce-data' %>.

### Step 2: Declare Ecommerce Data

Send your *Order* and *Item* data with the <%= link_to 'ecommerce', 'ecommerce/' %> commands. Ecommerce
commands **must be** added at the final step of your checkout process after a user has successfully completed a purchase.
Usually this is the *"Thank You"* or *"Receipt"* page.

> ##### Note
> You **must** first add the Tracking Code JS snippet, connect to your Account and then add the ecommerce commands.

#### Tracking an Order

Use the <%= link_to 'ecommerce:addOrder', 'ecommerce/#addorder' %> command to track the order.

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/order_beacon' %>

#### Tracking Items

Use the <%= link_to 'ecommerce:addItem', 'ecommerce/#additem' %> command to track the items of the order.

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/item_beacon' %>

#### Complete Example

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/complete_example' %>

Visit the <%= link_to 'examples', 'examples' %> to view complete implementation examples
for different programming languages.

### Step 3: Place test orders

Place test orders from the link that is available through
<%= link_to 'Merchants control panel', "https://#{settings.merchants_domain}/merchants/account/settings/analytics", target: :_blank %>,
in order to validate that you report successfully your sales insights.

> ##### Note
> You have to place a test order with every available payment method (card, paypal, pay in store, etc.).

### Step 4: Become GDPR / e-Privacy Compliant

We suggest to include the necessary references about Skroutz Analytics and Skroutz CPC/CPS, in your websiteâ€™s Cookie or Privacy Policy.

Detailed information can be found
<%= link_to 'here', '/analytics/privacy_policy', anchor: 'section-9' %>
or if your billing model is the Mixed Pricing Model CPC/CPS
<%= link_to 'here', '/analytics/cps_privacy_policy', anchor: 'section-8' %>.
